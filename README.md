# landing-page
Prior to starting:
    This project is a culmination of the knowledge I have gained through TOP. I will use a visual template provided, and through CSS and HTML, will attempt to re-create it. This project will use most, if not all, of the tools TOP has given me to produce not only a fully-functioning, but also an aesthetically-pleasing website.

After Finishing:
    This project was my very first true web page. Through it, I used many, if not all, of the Flexbox tools I learned through TOP. I found the project challenging, and I also found myself researching different CSS topics to make my design match. In the end, while not perfect, I felt I achieved a close resemblance to the template. I tested my skills, and now have a much deeper understanding of the concepts. I still have much more to learn, but this project made the creation of websites seem not as daunting, and the goal of creating my own aesthetic, pleasing-to-the-eve websites seem much more attainable.
